This readMe contains instructions on how to execute the source files for the CSCI 517 Final Project. The scripts were created by James Edwards and written in Python 3. Each script requires that the text files you want to run be in a specified folder. The path can be changed in a line towards the top of each script. I ran the scripts with all of the text files together alone in a folder with no subfolders. I am not attaching this folder as it is very large to add to blackboard. Once the path is set to where the text files are located, each script can be run like any other python script. The "dbscan.py" and "kmeansclustering.py" will print out the sse score for the clustering implementation, while the "epsPlot.py" will give a graph that can be used to determine the ideal epsilon used in the dbscan implementation. These scripts may take a long time to run. When I ran them, I incrementally created objects that could be reused that kept track of the distance between each point and the logFreqList of weighted tf values for each document. I did not know how to include these objects in the submission, so I have each script generating them.
