This ReadMe contains instructions on how to run the python script to spellcheck. The script was created by James Edwards for the Natural Language Processing class at Ole Miss in Fall 2018.
The source code is called 'EdwardsSpellChecker.py' and is turned in on blackboard. The program was written in Python3, and so you need that installed on your computer before you can run the spellchecker.
There are several .txt files located with the python script. Download all of these files and place them in whichever directory you choose, just make sure they are in the same one.
Open command prompt and change the directory to where you put the files. Once you have done this, type "EdwardsSpellChecker.py" without the quotation marks. The program will ask you to enter the name of the input file.
It should also be located in the same directory. Once the program runs, navigate to the directory and you will find a file called 'output.txt' located with the other files. 
This is the output generated from running the program.
